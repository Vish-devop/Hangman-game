Today, I am here to code for Hangman game.
Following logics I applyied in this game:

1. Using the random library
2. Making an input variable for the user name and saying hi
3. Making a list of words
4. Creating a variable that randomly choose words from out previous list
5. Telling the users to guess the characters.
6. Creating a guessing variable.
7. Creating a turns variable and setting it to any number.
8. Again crating a while loop for turns while greater than 0
9. Creating a variable in the while loop and call it failed and it equals to 0.
10. Creating a for loop inside the while loop 
11. Creating an if stmt in the for loop then print it, else print "_" and increase the failed varaible by one.
12. Creating an if statement inside the while loop for failed and setting it to 0 and if its true print you win otherwise print word and break
13. Create an input ion the guess variable to guess the character.
14. Store every input characters in the guesses variable.
15. Create an if stmt if guesses not in word then reduce "turns" by one and print wrong and print the number of turns left for the user.
16. if turns=0
you lose
